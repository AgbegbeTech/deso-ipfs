### **Introduction**

In the ever-evolving digital landscape, the convergence of blockchain technology and decentralized file storage has paved the way for groundbreaking developments in decentralized social media. **DeSo IPFS** combines the strengths of **DeSo** and **IPFS** to create a powerful, community-driven ecosystem capable of transforming how we interact online.

This project introduces a **comprehensive backend API** that integrates the social and economic capabilities of DeSo with the decentralized storage power of IPFS, providing the foundation for scalable, secure, and user-controlled applications.

### **The Synergy of DeSo and IPFS**

#### **DeSo (Decentralized Social Blockchain)**
- A blockchain designed for social media applications.
- Introduces transparency, immutability, and user autonomy.
- Provides tools for tipping, Creator Coins, and NFT management.

#### **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**
- Peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for decentralized file storage.
- Ensures faster data transfer and reduces dependency on centralized systems.
- Empowers users with control over their data.

By combining these technologies, DeSo IPFS creates a robust platform for decentralized social interactions and content sharing.

---

### **Framework Features**

1. **Decentralized Content Management**  
   - Upload files to IPFS and link metadata on DeSo.  
   - Retrieve content seamlessly from IPFS.  

2. **Social Layer for Interaction**  
   - Enable users to comment, like, tip, and engage with content.  
   - Build decentralized communities with profiles and follower systems.

3. **Monetization Tools**  
   - Gated content access with NFTs or $DESO payments.  
   - Creator Coins to incentivize community engagement.  

4. **Node Incentives and Rewards**  
   - Reward nodes based on uptime, storage capacity, and retrieval activity.  

5. **Extensibility**  
   - Modular design to support custom frontends for different use cases.

### **Backend API Overview**

#### **Key Components**

1. **User Subscription Management**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/subscribe` (POST) – Handles subscription transactions.
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/unsubscribe` (POST) – Manages unsubscriptions.
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/check-access` (GET) – Verifies user subscription status.

2. **Content Access Control**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/upload-content` (POST) – Uploads files to IPFS and links metadata on DeSo.
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/fetch-content` (GET) – Retrieves content from IPFS and DeSo.

3. **Financial Transactions**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/transaction/create` (POST) – Creates financial transactions for payments.

4. **Reward System**
   - **Metrics Tracked:** Uptime, retrieval activity, and storage capacity.
   - Rewards calculated and distributed to nodes in $DESO.

#### **Security and Performance**
- **Authentication:** Secures API access using JWT tokens.
- **Caching:** Optimizes frequently accessed content.
- **Validation:** Prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

### **Impact on Decentralized Social Media**

1. **Scalability and Performance**
   - IPFS ensures efficient handling of large files, making the platform highly scalable.

2. **Enhanced Privacy and Security**
   - Decentralized architecture minimizes data breaches and censorship.

3. **Economic Empowerment**
   - Direct monetization options for creators and contributors.

4. **Community Governance**
   - Decentralized governance ensures a user-driven platform evolution.
